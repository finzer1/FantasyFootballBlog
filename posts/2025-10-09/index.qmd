All Fantasy Points (i.e., Projected and Actual FPTS) Data and Analyses came directly from ESPN:https://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/story/_/page/FFWeeklyPlayerRank25-46104572/nfl-fantasy-football-rankings-2025-dst-defense

# Abstract {#sec-abstract}

**Background:** When choosing players for your Fantasy Football league, it can be challenging to know what exactly you should be looking at. Do you evaluate a player's age, injury history, team they're on, popularity, or past performance? Typically, my most widely used method for selecting players is evaluating the predicted projected points. But how accurate can projected points be in predicting actual points earned in a game?

**Method:** In the present study, I will analyze players in my Fantasy Football League and evaluate how accurately projected points earned is in predicting actual points earned in a game.

**Results:** The results of the study indicate that there isn't sufficient evidence to support a statistically significant relationship between projected points and actual points earned in a game. 

**Discussion:** Although it's important to note that, with a larger sample size, there would be sufficient evidence to support the relationship. It should be noted that there is no single main factor to focus on, but rather multiple factors/variables (i.e., when choosing a player for your Fantasy Football League). 

**Conclusion** Instead of fixating on only one factor (e.g., projected points) the best strategy is to examine a series of factors.  

# Background {#sec-background}

In Fantasy Football, there are dozens of factors that can be considered when choosing a player. As this is my first year participating in a fantasy football league (i.e., doing this all by myself), it can be overwhelming/challenging to know exactly where to look and what I should be looking at. Do you evaluate a player's age, injury history, team they're on, popularity, or past performance? For this study, I have chosen to evaluate how accurately projected points are in predicting actual points earned in last week's game (Week 5). 

As for my hypothesis, I hypothesized that projected points earned in will not be statistically significant in predicting actual points earned in Week 5. The justification for why I chose this hypothesis is based on one of my primary methods for selecting a player (i.e., projected points). Each week, it seemed I was going to win against my opponent, only to find out I had lost by over 40 points. So I have decided to see exactly how accurate these projections are in predicting actual points earned in a game. Additionally, it's essential to note that these projections aren't meant to be completely accurate (i.e., in approximately 90% of all cases, this instance can be observed) due to dozens of factors that come into play. While these projections serve a purpose, people shouldn't rely on them so heavily as the main factor in choosing a player.

# Method {#sec-method}

Each player has a series of stats, and from these stats, projections are made for each week. In order to test my hypothesis, I will incorporate my own players from my Fantasy Football League (e.g., starting/benched players as well as defense) and evaluate how accurate projected points earned are in predicting actual points earned in Week 5. 

# Data {#sec-data}

To begin, I have created a data frame containing all the data I will use.

```{r}
# create a data frame
df <- data.frame(
"Player_Name" = c("Jaxson Dart", "De'Von Achane", "Rico Dowdle", "Courtland Sutton", "Tre Tucker", "Sam LaPorta", "Nick Chubb", "Lions-Defense", "Spencer Shrader", "Jacory Croskey-Merritt", "Zach Ertz", "Bo Nix", "Darius Slayton", "Jaguars-Defense"),
"Projected_FPTS" = c(16.18, 19.63, 14.54, 12.90, 10.47, 10.09, 10.09, 7.18, 8.51, 7.77, 9.18, 16.09, 9.19, 4.92),
"Actual_FPTS" = c(15.58, 16.60, 32.40, 17.90, 11.10, 20.20, 12.10, 10.00, 2.00, 27.00, 0.00, 17.88, 4.10, 2.00)
)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::kable(df, caption = "My Fantasy Football Team - Projected vs. Actual Fantasy Points Earned For Week 5")
```

As you can see, I have listed each player from my Fantasy Football League along with their projected vs. actual fantasy points for Week 5. Let's evaluate the correlation of projected points to actual points earned visually and statistically:

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(
data = df,
aes (Projected_FPTS, Actual_FPTS, label = Player_Name)) +
  geom_point(
  size = 3,
  color = "blue") +
  geom_abline(
  slope = 1, 
  intercept = 0, 
  color = "red", 
  linetype = "dashed"
  ) +
  geom_text(vjust = -1.0, size = 3) +
  labs(
    x = "Projected_FPTS",
    y = "Actual_FPTS",
    title = "Projected vs. Actual Fantasy Points for Week 5"
) +
expand_limits(
  x = min(df$Projected_FPTS) - 5,
  y = max(df$Actual_FPTS) + 5
) +
theme_classic() +
theme(axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 0.5)) # horizontal y-axis title
```

```{r}
Player_Name <- c("Jaxson Dart", "De'Von Achane", "Rico Dowdle", "Courtland Sutton", "Tre Tucker", "Sam LaPorta", "Nick Chubb", "Lions-Defense", "Spencer Shrader", "Jacory Croskey-Merritt", "Zach Ertz", "Bo Nix", "Darius Slayton", "Jaguars-Defense")

Projected_FPTS <- c(16.18, 19.63, 14.54, 12.90, 10.47, 10.09, 10.09, 7.18, 8.51, 7.77, 9.18, 16.09, 9.19, 4.92)

Actual_FPTS <- c(15.58, 16.60, 32.40, 17.90, 11.10, 20.20, 12.10, 10.00, 2.00, 27.00, 0.00, 17.88, 4.10, 2.00)

cor.test(Projected_FPTS, Actual_FPTS)
```

# Results {#sec-results}

Based on the correlation above, this indicates a moderate relationship between projected vs. actual fantasy points. Therefore, the projected points are somewhat predictive, neither completely incorrect nor 100% correct. Unfortunately, the p-value (p = 0.088) indicates there isn't enough evidence for a statistically significant relationship. Therefore, my hypothesis was proven to be correct. As for significance, the relationship would have been considered statistically significant if I had a larger sample size. 

Regardless of whether the results are significant, I have taken it upon myself to introduce the potential confounds for each player. These confounds could explain why the actual points didn't match the projected points as closely.

# Potential Confounds {#sec-confounds}

**Jaxson Dart**

Analysis: "Though Tuesday's session wasn't conducted at full speed, Dart didn't face any limitations and looks to be ready to play Thursday against the Eagles. Head coach Brian Daboll acknowledged as much prior to the walkthrough, telling Evan Barnes of Newsday that Dart's sore left hamstring wasn't viewed as much of a concern, even on a short week."

Potential Confound: Hamstring Injury

**De'Von Achane**

Analysis: "Achane came into the interconference battle with elevated expectations, considering the struggles of the Panthers against the run and the fact Tyreek Hill's (IR, knee) absence was expected to open up even more pass-catching opportunities for the versatile back."

Potential Confound: Absence of Other Player (i.e., due to injury) 

**Rico Dowdle**

Analysis: "Stepping into the lead-back role in place of Chuba Hubbard (calf), Dowdle exceeded all expectations in his first opportunity to helm the ground attack in Carolina. Dowdle repeatedly knifed the Dolphins' front seven for big gains, including 43- and 53-yard scampers."

Potential Confound: Absence of Other Player (i.e., due to injury) 

**Courtland Sutton**

Analysis: "Sutton led the Broncos in receptions, receiving yards and targets on the afternoon, recording a team-high 34-yard catch along the way. The veteran wideout fell just short of what would have been his second 100-yard game of the campaign, but he's now posted at least 81 receiving yards in three straight contests."

Potential Confound: Age

**Tre Tucker**

Analysis: "Tucker led the team in receiving yards while checking in tied for second in both receptions and targets. The speedy third-year pro recorded a team-best 33-yard catch in the process, Tucker's fourth reception of 20-plus yards this season. Despite Geno Smith's interception troubles over the first five games of his Raiders tenure, the chemistry between the veteran signal-caller and Tucker seems to be solid heading into a Week 6 home matchup against a beatable Titans defense."

Potential Confound: Better Communication with other Teammate

**Sam LaPorta**

Analysis: "LaPorta made a quick impact in Sunday's blowout win, logging a 22-yard reception on the third play of the game before capping the drive with an athletic 10-yard catch and run that resulted in a touchdown. His longest gain of the day came early in the third quarter and went for 39 yards -- nearly entirely after the catch."

Potential Confound: Bad Defense of Other Team

**Nick Chubb**

Analysis: "Chubb looked to be losing his grip as the clear leader of the Houston backfield after Week 4, though he out-touched rookie Woody Marks 11-7 in Sunday's blowout win. Despite Baltimore playing without several of their run-stopping defenders, Chubb was held in check for much of the day. However, he broke loose for a 27-yard touchdown scamper early in the third quarter to account for nearly half of his yardage."

Potential Confound: Age

**Lions-Defense**

Analysis: Actual score was higher than projection and ended up winning 37-24 against the Cincinnati Bengals.

**Spencer Shrader**

Analysis: "His move to IR opens up room on the 53-man roster for Michael Badgley, whom the Colts signed to step in as their new kicker in place of Shrader, who will miss the rest of the season after suffering ACL and MCL tears to his right knee in Sunday's 40-6 win over the Raiders."

Potential Confound: Major Knee Injury

**Jacory Croskey-Merritt**

Analysis: "Croskey-Merritt finally broke out of the backfield committee that was holding him back in fantasy with a dominating two-touchdown performance against the Chargers. The seventh-round rookie commanded 14 of Washington's 20 running-back carries Sunday, eclipsing a personal high of 10 set back in his initial breakout game in Week 1. One would assume that the 150-yard, multi-score showing should cement the starting job for the Arizona product moving forward."

Potential Confound: Bad Defense of Other Team

**Zach Ertz**

Analysis: "Despite Jayden Daniels returning from a knee injury in Week 5, Ertz had his worst game of the season. He was targeted just once and didn't appear to be a part of the Commanders' offensive game plan. Ertz still logged 30 offensive snaps and operated as Washington's No. 1 tight end, playing ahead of John Bates (28 snaps) and Ben Sinnott (17 snaps)."

Potential Confound: Performance Level Declining

**Bo Nix**

Analysis: "Nix had his fair share of struggles against the Eagles' talented defense, but he helped lead Denver back from a 17-3 second-half deficit. Nix led a trio of fourth-quarter scoring drives, capping one of them with an 11-yard touchdown pass to Evan Engram and following it up with a two-point conversion toss to Troy Franklin."

Potential Confound: Tough Defense

**Darius Slayton**

Analysis: "After tweaking his hamstring in Sunday's 26-14 loss to the Saints, Slayton could be hard-pressed to make a full recovery from the injury ahead of the Giants' Week 6 matchup with the Eagles on Thursday night. Daboll suggested that Slayton is trending toward being a game-time decision for Thursday, though the Giants will wait until Wednesday before formally giving the wideout a designation heading into the contest."

Potential Confound: Hamstring Injury

**Jaguars-Defense**

Analysis: Actual score was lower than projection but ended up winning against the Chiefs 31-28.

Potential Confound: Tough Defense

# Discussion {#sec-discussion}

Based on the results of the study, there isn't enough evidence to support a statistically significant relationship between projected points earned vs. actual points earned in Fantasy Football. Although it's important to note that, with a larger sample size, there would be sufficient evidence to support the relationship. A callback to my background on the study, I mentioned how it can be difficult to pinpoint precisely what variables we should be looking at/considering when choosing a player for your Fantasy Football league. It should be noted that there is no single main factor to be looked at primarily, but instead multiple factors/variables. From the potential confounds section, you can see a variety of factors that effectively impacted the player's performance.  

# Strengths and Limitations {#sec-strengthsLimitations}

**Strengths**

The results of my study could be statistically significant if a larger sample size were assessed, indicating that, (without looking at the sample size) the data would be statistically significant.  

The implemented visuals help the reader see the differences between projected points and actual points earned in Week 5. 

**Limitations**

The study assessed only two variables (e.g., Projected and Actual Points), thereby decreasing its internal validity. Additionally, more variables would provide us with a more complex/deeper understanding of the relationship.

A smaller sample size inevitably decreases the study's statistical significance, thereby lowering generalizability and external validity.

# Conclusion {#sec-conclusion}

In conclusion, the results of the study failed to provide sufficient evidence to support a statistically significant relationship between the predicted and actual points earned in the game. Thus, my hypothesis that there would be no statistically significant relationship between the two was correct. Although if I had added more players to the study, my results could have turned out differently. But perhaps the results aren't statistically significant because a variety of factors come into play, such as age, opponent's defensive strength, injury, etc. This suggests that there is no single factor to evaluate, but rather that examining a range of factors is the best approach. Therefore, in terms of strategies, the best approach is to avoid fixating on a single factor and instead evaluate several factors.
