# Abstract {#sec-abstract}

**Background:** When choosing players for your fantasy football team, it can be challenging to know what exactly you should be looking at. Do you evaluate a player's age, injury history, team they're on, popularity, or past performance? Typically, one of the most widely used methods for selecting players is evaluating their past performance. But how accurate can past performance be in predicting future performance?

**Method:** In the present study, I will analyze my own players on my fantasy football team and evaluate how accurate their past performance is in predicting their future performance. 


**Results:** 


**Discussion:** 



# Background {#sec-background}

In fantasy football, there are dozens of factors that can be considered when choosing a player. As this is my first year participating in a fantasy football league (i.e., doing this all by myself), it can be challenging to know exactly what I should be looking at. Do you evaluate a player's age, injury history, team they're on, popularity, or past performance? Out of all these factors, past performance is likely the most popular factorâ€”and it makes sense. But, statistically, how accurate can past performance be in predicting future performance? 

In this study, I will investigate the statistical significance of past performance in predicting future performance. As for my hypothesis, past performance will not be statistically significant in predicting future performance. This hypothesis is justified because the estimated projected points that a player earns are consistently inaccurate for me when compared to the actual points they earn. Additionally, it's essential to note that these projections aren't meant to be completely accurate (i.e., in approximately 90% of all cases, this instance can be observed) due to dozens of factors that come into play. While these projections serve a purpose, people shouldn't rely on them so heavily as the main factor in choosing a player.

# Method {#sec-method}

Each player has a series of season stat projections so to test this hypothesis, I will incorporate my own players from my fantasy football team (e.g., starting/benched players as well as defense) and evaluate how accurate each player's season stat projections have been so far. 

# Data {#sec-data}

```{r}
#| echo: false
# create a data frame
df <- data.frame(
"Player_Name" = c("Jaxson Dart", "De'Von Achane", "Rico Dowdle", "Courtland Sutton", "Tre Tucker", "Sam LaPorta", "Nick Chubb", "Lions-Defense", "Spencer Shrader", "Jacory Croskey-Merritt", "Zach Ertz", "Bo Nix", "Darius Slayton", "Jaguars-Defense"),
"Projected_FPTS" = c(16.18, 19.63, 14.54, 12.90, 10.47, 10.09, 10.09, 7.18, 8.51, 7.77, 9.18, 16.09, 9.19, 4.92),
"Actual_FPTS" = c(15.58, 16.60, 32.40, 17.90, 11.10, 20.20, 12.10, 10.00, 2.00, 27.00, 0.00, 17.88, 4.10, 2.00)
)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::kable(df, caption = "My Fantasy Football Team - Projected vs. Actual Fantasy Points Earned According to ESPN")
```


## Statistical Analysis {#sec-statisticalAnalysis}

As you can see in the data frame, I have listed each player along with projected vs. actual fantasy points earned. Let's evaluate the correlation of projected to actual fantasy points earned visually:

```{r}
#| echo: false
cor(df$Projected_FPTS, df$Actual_FPTS)
```


```{r}
#| echo: false
ggplot2::ggplot(
data = df,
aes (Projected_FPTS, Actual_FPTS, label = Player_Name)) +
  geom_point(
  size = 3,
  color = "blue") +
  geom_abline(
  slope = 1, 
  intercept = 0, 
  color = "red", 
  linetype = "dashed"
  ) +
  geom_text(vjust = -1.0, size = 3) +
  labs(
    x = "Projected_FPTS",
    y = "Actual_FPTS",
    title = "Projected vs. Actual Fantasy Points for Week 5"
) +
expand_limits(
  x = min(df$Projected_FPTS) - 5,
  y = max(df$Actual_FPTS) + 5
) +
theme_classic() +
theme(axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 0.5)) # horizontal y-axis title
```


```{r}

# Potential Confounds {#sec-confounds}

**Jaxson Dart**

Analysis: "Though Tuesday's session wasn't conducted at full speed, Dart didn't face any limitations and looks to be ready to play Thursday against the Eagles. Head coach Brian Daboll acknowledged as much prior to the walkthrough, telling Evan Barnes of Newsday that Dart's sore left hamstring wasn't viewed as much of a concern, even on a short week."

Potential Confound: Hamstring Injury

**De'Von Achane**

Analysis: "Achane came into the interconference battle with elevated expectations, considering the struggles of the Panthers against the run and the fact Tyreek Hill's (IR, knee) absence was expected to open up even more pass-catching opportunities for the versatile back."

Potential Confound: Absence of Other Player (i.e., due to injury) 

**Rico Dowdle**

Analysis: "Stepping into the lead-back role in place of Chuba Hubbard (calf), Dowdle exceeded all expectations in his first opportunity to helm the ground attack in Carolina. Dowdle repeatedly knifed the Dolphins' front seven for big gains, including 43- and 53-yard scampers."

Potential Confound: Absence of Other Player (i.e., due to injury) 

**Courtland Sutton**

Analysis: "Sutton led the Broncos in receptions, receiving yards and targets on the afternoon, recording a team-high 34-yard catch along the way. The veteran wideout fell just short of what would have been his second 100-yard game of the campaign, but he's now posted at least 81 receiving yards in three straight contests."

Potential Confound: Age

**Tre Tucker**

Analysis: "Tucker led the team in receiving yards while checking in tied for second in both receptions and targets. The speedy third-year pro recorded a team-best 33-yard catch in the process, Tucker's fourth reception of 20-plus yards this season. Despite Geno Smith's interception troubles over the first five games of his Raiders tenure, the chemistry between the veteran signal-caller and Tucker seems to be solid heading into a Week 6 home matchup against a beatable Titans defense."

Potential Confound: Better Communication with other Teammate

**Sam LaPorta**

Analysis: "LaPorta made a quick impact in Sunday's blowout win, logging a 22-yard reception on the third play of the game before capping the drive with an athletic 10-yard catch and run that resulted in a touchdown. His longest gain of the day came early in the third quarter and went for 39 yards -- nearly entirely after the catch."

Potential Confound: Bad Defense of Other Team

**Nick Chubb**

Analysis: "Chubb looked to be losing his grip as the clear leader of the Houston backfield after Week 4, though he out-touched rookie Woody Marks 11-7 in Sunday's blowout win. Despite Baltimore playing without several of their run-stopping defenders, Chubb was held in check for much of the day. However, he broke loose for a 27-yard touchdown scamper early in the third quarter to account for nearly half of his yardage."

Potential Confound: Age

**Lions-Defense**

Analysis: Actual score was higher than projection and ended up winning 37-24 against the Cincinnati Bengals.

**Spencer Shrader**

Analysis: "His move to IR opens up room on the 53-man roster for Michael Badgley, whom the Colts signed to step in as their new kicker in place of Shrader, who will miss the rest of the season after suffering ACL and MCL tears to his right knee in Sunday's 40-6 win over the Raiders."

Potential Confound: Major Knee Injury

**Jacory Croskey-Merritt**

Analysis: "Croskey-Merritt finally broke out of the backfield committee that was holding him back in fantasy with a dominating two-touchdown performance against the Chargers. The seventh-round rookie commanded 14 of Washington's 20 running-back carries Sunday, eclipsing a personal high of 10 set back in his initial breakout game in Week 1. One would assume that the 150-yard, multi-score showing should cement the starting job for the Arizona product moving forward."

Potential Confound: Bad Defense of Other Team

**Zach Ertz**

Analysis: "Despite Jayden Daniels returning from a knee injury in Week 5, Ertz had his worst game of the season. He was targeted just once and didn't appear to be a part of the Commanders' offensive game plan. Ertz still logged 30 offensive snaps and operated as Washington's No. 1 tight end, playing ahead of John Bates (28 snaps) and Ben Sinnott (17 snaps)."

Potential Confound: Performance Level Declining

**Bo Nix**

Analysis: "Nix had his fair share of struggles against the Eagles' talented defense, but he helped lead Denver back from a 17-3 second-half deficit. Nix led a trio of fourth-quarter scoring drives, capping one of them with an 11-yard touchdown pass to Evan Engram and following it up with a two-point conversion toss to Troy Franklin."

Potential Confound: Tough Defense

**Darius Slayton**

Analysis: "After tweaking his hamstring in Sunday's 26-14 loss to the Saints, Slayton could be hard-pressed to make a full recovery from the injury ahead of the Giants' Week 6 matchup with the Eagles on Thursday night. Daboll suggested that Slayton is trending toward being a game-time decision for Thursday, though the Giants will wait until Wednesday before formally giving the wideout a designation heading into the contest."

Potential Confound: Hamstring Injury

**Jaguars-Defense**

Analysis: Actual score was lower than projection but ended up winning against the Chiefs 31-28.

Potential Confound: Tough Defense
